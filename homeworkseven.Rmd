# DS 413/613     HOMEWORK 7    Web Scraping and Rectangling
# Instructions:  Create an R markdown file and a Word file and push
# both files to a Repository that you have created in GitHub. 
# Required packages and libraries are given below; 
# install.packages("rvest") 
# install.packages("listviewer") 
#listviewer::jsonedit(gh_users)  
library(rvest)   
library(dplyr)   
library(tidyverse)  
library(repurrrsive)

# 1)  Using the following link,  https://www.imdb.com/list/ls091520106/, 
# R coding for Web scraping and Selector Gadget, produce the following tibble. 
# (The first 5 rows are shown below)  Use the step by step methodology 
# suggested in class showing all steps and code. 
Link <- "https://www.imdb.com/list/ls091520106/"
page = read_html(Link)
Movienames = page%>% html_nodes(".lister-item-header a")%>%
  html_text()
Movienames

Link <- "https://www.imdb.com/list/ls091520106/"
page = read_html(Link)
Ratings = page%>% html_nodes(".ipl-rating-star__rating")%>%
  html_text()
Ratings


Link <- "https://www.imdb.com/list/ls091520106/"
page = read_html(Link)
Runtime = page%>% html_nodes(".runtime")%>%
  html_text()
Runtime

moviesdataframe = data.frame(Movienames,Ratings,Runtime)
moviesdataframe

# Now let's improve the format and appearance of the data table by transforming
# into a tibble

is_tibble(moviesdataframe)


as_tibble(moviesdataframe)


# 2)
# a) Explain or describe nested Lists.  (Three or four sentences)
 # A nested list is a list within a list. Nested lists can get complicated so they 
 # usually need to be transformed into a data frame for better understanding. They can be 
 # used to be arranged in hierarical structures. 
# b) Open and explore data for Git Hub repos by running the following code gh_repo.  
# Comment on the structure and arrangement of the data (Two or three sentences)

listviewer::jsonedit(gh_repos)
#gh_repos
# withiin the gh_repos, there are 6 lists of repositiories that belong to a user. 5 of the lists have thirty lists. 
# one list has 26 lists. within each of those 26/30 lists are another list of 68 variables, there are 68 variables. 

 
# c)  In two or three sentences, explain what happens to the data when you run the code; 
repos <- tibble(repo = gh_repos)
repos
# With this code, we organized the data into a tibble. This makes it easier to see how many lists and elements are in the repo. 
# it summarizes the data for us into a more organized comprehensive way. It also makes bundling and 
# extracting easier. 
# d)  Describe the data representation when the listserver tool is applied. 
# And go into detail explaining why we have a nested List configuration.
# What do the numbers 30 and 68 represent ? (6 or 7 sentences)
# Run the following code:
  listviewer::jsonedit(gh_repos)

# It shows the layers of the list. The number 30 represents how many lists are within the original 
# six lists that belong to github users. the 68 represents the number of variables in the 30 lists. This function makes 
# it easier to view data details as well as explore how many lists and variables there are. It also 
  #allows us to search through the entire data and nested lists. 


# e)  Use and show R unesting code to produce the tibble below.
  tibble(repo = gh_repos) %>% 
    unnest_auto(repo) %>% 
    unnest_auto(repo)
